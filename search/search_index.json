This is because a USPMO is a bearer instrument\u2014as long as the money order itself is valid, it doesn't matter who sent it or what the sender's address is.</li> <li>Consider using an online name generator (search \"random name generator\" on your favorite search engine) for a more bias-free suggestion for the sender's name.</li> <li>For the sender's address, you may want to be more careful, because if your envelope is returned, you'll want to be able to retrieve it.</li> <li>Option 1: Use an actual fake address (search internet for \"random address generator\"). If your envelope is returned for any reason, you'll probably lose it for good.</li> <li>Option 2: Use another address.

Buying Monero with USPMO is a rare exception.</p> <p>Note: Trading using US Postal Money Orders (USPMO) on Haveno requires that you understand the following: - XMR buyers must write the XMR Seller\u2019s name in both the Payer and the Payee\u2019s fields &amp; take a high-resolution photo of the USPMO and envelope with proof of tracking before sending. - XMR buyers must send the USPMO to the XMR seller with Delivery Confirmation.</p> <p>In the event mediation is necessary, or if there is a trade dispute, you will be required to send the photos to the Haveno arbitrator or refund agent, together with the USPMO Serial Number, Post Office Number, and dollar amount, so they can verify the details on the US Post Office website.</p> <p>Failure to provide the required information to the arbitrator or Arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case.</p> <p>In all dispute cases, the USPMO sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in providing evidence/proof to the arbitrator or Arbitrator.</p> <p>If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade using USPMO on Haveno.</p>"},{"location":"the-project/payment_methods/US_Postal_Money_Order/#buying-the-money-order","title":"Buying the money order","text":"<p>It is highly recommended to use cash to buy the USPMO.

Then, that 2nd Teller accepted my $800 money order, gave me her $300 in her drawer, and printed me the difference of $500 as a new money order. Finally, the 3rd Teller used the $700 in his drawer to fully redeem my $500 money order.
